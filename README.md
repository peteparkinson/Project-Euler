# Project-Euler

WIP.  currently solutions for problems 1 through about 50.
not all have been optimized, usually there's a note saying if the solution
needs attention.

There are separate reference files that store data for some problems.
for the java solutions, the reference files are 1 folder above "src".

there are several problems left unsolved in python.
